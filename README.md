Here’s a professional README draft for your `Code-Quality` repository:

# Code-Quality

Sharing Code Quality Best Practices

## Overview

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows and guidelines for maintaining high-quality code in both backend and frontend projects. It provides automated checks such as linting, formatting, dependency management, and basic tests, ensuring consistent standards across projects.

---

## Features

* **Python Backend Quality Checks**

  * Linting using [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)
  * Code formatting checks
  * Basic unit testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

* **Frontend Quality Checks**

  * Detects Node.js project type (npm, Yarn, pnpm)
  * Dependency installation with caching for faster CI runs
  * TypeScript type checks (if applicable)
  * Build verification
  * ESLint checks, including unused variables and imports

* **Reusable GitHub Actions Workflow**

  * Can be triggered via `workflow_call` from other repositories
  * Supports push, pull_request, and manual triggers
  * Parameterized paths for backend and frontend projects

---

## Usage

### 1. Include the Workflow

To use the reusable workflow from another repository:

```yaml
name: Run Full Stack Quality Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: ["Dev"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["Dev"]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  call-quality-checker:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/codeQualityChecker.yml
    with:
      branch: "Dev"
      backend_path: "backend"
      frontend_path: "Frontend"
      lockfile_paths: "Frontend/package-lock.json"
```

### 2. Inputs

| Input            | Description                                   | Default      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `branch`         | Target branch for code checks                 | `"Dev"`      |
| `backend_path`   | Path to backend project folder                | `"backend"`  |
| `frontend_path`  | Path to frontend project folder               | `"Frontend"` |
| `lockfile_paths` | Path(s) to lockfiles for caching dependencies |Frontend/package-lock.json        |

### 3. Supported Package Managers

* **npm**: `package-lock.json` (tested)
* **Yarn**: `yarn.lock`
* **pnpm**: `pnpm-lock.yaml`

---

## Benefits

* Ensures consistent coding standards across multiple projects
* Reduces manual effort in running lint, tests, and build commands
* Speeds up CI with dependency caching
* Easily extendable for additional quality checks

I can also draft a **shorter “quick start” README** specifically for developers who just want to plug this workflow into their repo. Do you want me to do that?
